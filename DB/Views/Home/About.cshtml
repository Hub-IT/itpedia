        A synergy between DEREE CIS department and BYTE Computer has been established to develop a website to inform and advise new entrepreneurs, public and private firms interested in establishing or upgrading the IS and infrastructure of their business. CIS students have performed the requirements specification process and also developed a prototype website in the framework of the software development courses in their major program of study with content provided by Byte Computer SA. Following this, senior IT students have implemented and updated it.

        The academic department of Computer Information Systems (CIS) was established in the beginning of the 1980s at DEREE offering one of the first accredited information systems programs in Greece. Today, through academic collaborations, professional partnerships with top global corporations and an expanding network of professionals we aim at exposing students to latest trends and best practices in management information systems and therefore add value to their studies.
